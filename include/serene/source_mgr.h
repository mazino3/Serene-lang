/// the content of the `.srn` (or any of the `DEFAULT_SUFFIX`) into a
/// `llvm::MemoryBuffer` embedded in a `SrcBuffer` object as the owner of the
/// source files and then it will call the `reader` on the buffer to parse it
/// and create the actual `Namespace` object from the parsed AST.
///
/// Later on, whenever we need to refer to the source file of a namespace for
/// diagnosis purposes or any other purpose we can use the functions in this
/// class to get hold of a pointer to a specific `reader::Location` of the
/// buffer.

/// and it uses the Serene's `DiagnosticEngine` for that matter.
