- [[https://suif.stanford.edu/dragonbook/][Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools (The Dragon Book)]]
*** Common Steps
- Frontend

  - Syntax analyzer (Parser)
  - Semantic analyzer
- Middleend
  - Intermediate code generation
  - Code optimizer
- Backend
  - Target code generation
** LLVM
[[llvm.org]]
*** Watch [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xExRGaIIY][Introdution to LLVM]]
*** Quick overview
Deducted from https://www.aosabook.org/en/llvm.html
[[./imgs/llvm_dia.svg]]
- It's a set of libraries to create a compiler.
- Well engineered.
- we can focus only on the fronted of the compiler and what is
  actually important to us and leave the tricky stuff to LLVM.
- LLVM IR enables us to use multiple languages together.
- It supports many targets.
- We can benefit from already made IR level optimizers.
- ....

** MLIR
[[mlir.llvm.org]]
[[./imgs/mlir_dia.svg]]

- With MLIR dialects provide higher level semantics than LLVM IR.
- It's easier to reason about higher level IR that is modeled after
  the AST rather than a low level IR.
- We can use the pass infrastructure to efficiently process and transform the IR.
- With many ready to use dialects we can really focus on our language and us the other
  dialect when ever necessary.
- ...
** Serene
*** A Compiler frontend
*** Flow
- =serenec= in parses the command lines args
- =reader= reads the input file and generates an =AST=
- =semantic analyzer= walks the =AST= and generates a new =AST= and rewrites
  the necessary nodes.
- =slir= generator generates =slir= dialect code from =AST=.
- We lower =slir= to other dialects of the *MLIR* which we call the result =mlir=.
- Then, We lower everything to the =LLVMIR dialect= and call it =lir= (lowered IR).
- Finally we fully lower =lir= to =LLVM IR= and pass it to the object generator
  to generate object files.
- Call the default =c compiler= to link the object files and generate the machine code.
* DONE Episode 4 - The reader
CLOSED: [2021-07-27 Tue 22:50]
** What is a Parser ?
To put it simply, Parser converts the source code to an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree][AST]]
*** Algorithms
- LL(k)
- LR
- LALR
- PEG
- .....

Read More:
- https://stereobooster.com/posts/an-overview-of-parsing-algorithms/
- https://tomassetti.me/guide-parsing-algorithms-terminology/
*** Libraries
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_parser_generators
*** Our Parser
- We have a hand written LL(1.5) like parser/lexer since lisp already has a structure.
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  ;; pseudo code
  (def some-fn (fn (x y)
                   (+ x y)))
  (defn main ()
    (println "Result: " (some-fn 3 8)))
#+END_SRC
- LL(1.5)?
- O(n)
* DONE Episode 5 - The Abstract Syntax Tree
CLOSED: [2021-07-30 Fri 14:01]
** What is an AST?
Ast is a tree representation of the abstract syntactic structure of source code. It's just a tree made of nodes that each node is
a data structure describing the syntax.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  ;; pseudo code
  (def main (fn () 4))
  (prn (main))
#+END_SRC


[[./imgs/ast.svg]]
** The =Expression= abstract class
*** Expressions
- Expressions vs Statements
- Serene(Lisp) and expressions
** Node & AST
* DONE Episode 6 - The Semantic Analyzer
CLOSED: [2021-08-21 Sat 18:44]
** Qs
- Why didn't we implement a linked list?
- Why we are using the =std::vector= instead of llvm collections?
** What is Semantic Analysis?
- Semantic Analysis makes sure that the given program is semantically correct.
- Type checkr works as part of this step as well.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  ;; pseudo code
  (4 main)
#+END_SRC

[[./imgs/incorrct_semantic.svg]]
** Semantic Analysis and rewrites
We need to reform the AST to reflect the semantics of Serene closly.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  ;; pseudo code
  (def main (fn () 4))
  (prn (main))
#+END_SRC
[[./imgs/ast.svg]]

[[./imgs/semantic.svg]]

Let's run the compiler to see the semantic analysis in action.
** Let's check out the code
* DONE Episode 7 - The Context and Namespace
CLOSED: [2021-09-04 Sat 10:53]
** Namespaces
*** Unit of compilation
*** Usually maps to a file
*** keeps the state and evironment
** SereneContext vs LLVM Context vs MLIR Context
*** Compilers global state
*** The owner of LLVM/MLIR contexts
*** Holds the namespace table
*** Probably will contain the primitive types as well
* DONE Episode 8 - MLIR Basics
CLOSED: [2021-09-17 Fri 10:18]
** Serene Changes
- Introducing a SourceManager
- Reader changes
- *serenec* cli interface in changing

** Disclaimer
*I'm not an expert in MLIR*

** Why?
- A bit of history
- LLVM IR is to low level
- We need an IR to implement high level concepts and flows
  *MLIR* is a framework to build a compiler with your own IR. kinda :P

- Reusability
- ...
** Language
*** Overview
- SSA Based (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form)
- Typed
- Context free(for lack of better words)

*** Dialects
- A collection of operations
- Custom types
- Meta data
- We can use a mixture of different dialects
**** builtin dialects:
- std
- llvm
- math
- async
- ...

*** Opetations
- Higher level of abstraction
- Not instructions
- SSA forms
- Tablegen backend
- Verifiers and printers
*** Attributes
*** Blocks & Regions
*** Types
- Extesible
** Pass Infrastructure
Analysis and transformation infrastructure

- We will implement most of our semantic analysis logic and type checker as passes

** Pattern Rewriting
- Tablegen backed
** Operation Definition Specification
** Examples
*Not*: You need =mlir-mode= and =llvm-mode= available to you for the code highlighting of
the following code blocks. Both of those are distributed with the LLVM.

*** General syntax
#+BEGIN_SRC mlir
  %result:2 = "somedialect.blah"(%x#2) { some.attribute = true, other_attribute = 3 }
  : (!somedialect<"example_type">) -> (!somedialect<"foo_s">, i8)
  loc(callsite("main" at "main.srn":10:8))
#+END_SRC

*** Blocks and Regions
#+BEGIN_SRC mlir
  func @simple(i64, i1) -> i64 {
  ^bb0(%a: i64, %cond: i1): // Code dominated by ^bb0 may refer to %a
  cond_br %cond, ^bb1, ^bb2

  ^bb1:
  br ^bb3(%a: i64)    // Branch passes %a as the argument

  ^bb2:
  %b = addi %a, %a : i64
  br ^bb3(%b: i64)    // Branch passes %b as the argument

  // ^bb3 receives an argument, named %c, from predecessors
  // and passes it on to bb4 along with %a. %a is referenced
  // directly from its defining operation and is not passed through
  // an argument of ^bb3.
  ^bb3(%c: i64):
  //br ^bb4(%c, %a : i64, i64)
  "serene.ifop"(%c) ({ // if %a is in-scope in the containing region...
  // then %a is in-scope here too.
  %new_value = "another_op"(%c) : (i64) -> (i64)

  ^someblock(%new_value):
  %x = "some_other_op"() {value = 4 : i64} : () -> i64

  }) : (i64) -> (i64)
  ^bb4(%d : i64, %e : i64):
  %0 = addi %d, %e : i64
  return %0 : i64   // Return is also a terminator.
  }

- Pass around MLIR context
- Create Builder objects that creates operations in specific
  locations

- [X] Define the operations
- [X] Walk the AST and generate the operations

* DONE Episode 10 - Pass Infrastructure
CLOSED: [2021-10-15 Fri 14:17]
** The next Step
** Updates:
*** CMake changes
** What is a Pass
*** Passes are the unit of abstraction for optimization and transformation in LLVM/MLIR
*** Compilation is all about transforming the input data and produce an output

Source code -> IR X -> IR Y -> IR Z -> ... -> Target Code

*** Almost like a function composition
*** The big picture
*** Pass Managers (Pipelines) are made out of a collection of passes and can be nested
*** The most of the interesting parts of the compiler reside in Passes.
*** We will probably spend most of our time working with passes

** Pass Infrastructure
*** ODS or C++
*** Operation is the main abstract unit of transformation
*** OperationPass is the base class for all the passes.
*** We need to override =runOnOperation=
*** There's some rules you need to follow when defining your Pass
**** Must not maintain any global mutable state
**** Must not modify the state of another operation not nested within the current operation being operated on
**** ...

*** Passes are either OpSpecific or OpAgnostic
**** OpSpecific
#+BEGIN_SRC C++
  struct MyFunctionPass : public PassWrapper<MyFunctionPass,
                                             OperationPass<FuncOp>> {
    void runOnOperation() override {
      // Get the current FuncOp operation being operated on.
      FuncOp f = getOperation();

      // Walk the operations within the function.
      f.walk([](Operation *inst) {
        // ....
      });
    }
  };

  /// Register this pass so that it can be built via from a textual pass pipeline.
  /// (Pass registration is discussed more below)
  void registerMyPass() {
    PassRegistration<MyFunctionPass>();
  }
#+END_SRC
**** OpAgnostic
#+BEGIN_SRC C++
  struct MyOperationPass : public PassWrapper<MyOperationPass, OperationPass<>> {
    void runOnOperation() override {
      // Get the current operation being operated on.
      Operation *op = getOperation();
      // ...
    }
  };
#+END_SRC
*** How transformation works?
*** Analyses and Passes
*** Pass management and nested pass managers
#+BEGIN_SRC C++
  // Create a top-level `PassManager` class. If an operation type is not
  // explicitly specific, the default is the builtin `module` operation.
  PassManager pm(ctx);

  // Note: We could also create the above `PassManager` this way.
  PassManager pm(ctx, /*operationName=*/"builtin.module");

  // Add a pass on the top-level module operation.
  pm.addPass(std::make_unique<MyModulePass>());

  // Nest a pass manager that operates on `spirv.module` operations nested
  // directly under the top-level module.
  OpPassManager &nestedModulePM = pm.nest<spirv::ModuleOp>();
  nestedModulePM.addPass(std::make_unique<MySPIRVModulePass>());

  // Nest a pass manager that operates on functions within the nested SPIRV
  // module.
  OpPassManager &nestedFunctionPM = nestedModulePM.nest<FuncOp>();
  nestedFunctionPM.addPass(std::make_unique<MyFunctionPass>());

  // Run the pass manager on the top-level module.
  ModuleOp m = ...;
  if (failed(pm.run(m))) {
    // Handle the failure
   }

* DONE Episode 11 - Lowering SLIR
CLOSED: [2021-11-01 Mon 15:14]
** Overview
- What is a Pass?
- Pass Manager
** Dialect lowering
*** Why?
*** Transforming a dialect to another dialect or LLVM IR
*** The goal is to lower SLIR to LLVM IR directly or indirectly.
** Dialect Conversions
This framework allows for transforming a set of illegal operations to a set of legal ones.
*** Target Conversion
*** Rewrite Patterns
*** Type Converter
** Full vs Partial Conversion
* DONE Episode 12 - Target code generation
CLOSED: [2021-11-04 Thu 00:57]
** Updates:
*** JIT work
*** Emacs dev mode
** So far....
** Next Step
*** Compile to object files
*** Link object files to create an executable
** End of wiring for static compilers
** What is an object file?
*** Symbols
- A pair of a name and a value
- Value of a *defined symbol* is an offset in the =Content=
- *undefined symbols*
*** Relocations
Are computation to perform on the =Content=. For example, "set
this location in the contents to the value of this symbol plus this addend".

Linker will apply all the *relocations* in an object file on link time and if
it can not resolve an undefined symbol most of the time it will raise an
error (depending on the relocation and the symbol).

*** Contents
- Are what memory should look like during the execution
- Have a size
- Have a type
- Have an array of bytes
- Has sections like:
  + .text: The target code generated by the compiler
  + .data: The values of initialized variables
  + .rdata: Static unnamed data like literal strings, protocol tables and ....
  + .bss: Uninitialized variables (the content can be omitted or striped and assume
    to contain only zeros)
** Linking process
During the linking process, linker assigns an address to each *defined* symbol
and tries to =resolve= *undefined* symbols
*** Linker will
- reads the object files
- reads the contents
  + as raw data
  + figures out the length
  + reads the symbols and create a symbol table
  + link undefined symbols to their definitions (possibly from other obj fils or libs)
  + decide where all the content should go in the memory
  + sort them based on the *type*
  + concat them together
  + apply relocations
  + write the result to a file as an executable

- Trade off
  Compilation speed vs Execution speed
*** JIT vs Typical interpreters

** Why to use JIT?
- Make the interpreter to run "faster" (air quote again)
- Speed up the compilation
  Avoid generating the target code and generate some byte-code instead
  and then use a JIT in runtime to execute the byte-code.
- Use runtime data to find optimization opportunities.
- Support more archs
- And many other reasons
** How we're going to use a JIT?
- We need a JIT engine to implement Lisp Macros
- Compile time vs Runtime
  + Abstraction
- A JIT engine to just compile Serene code
- Our compiler will be a fancy JIT engine

** LLVM/MLIR and JIT
- 3 different approaches
- MLIR's JIT
- LLVM JITs
  + MCJIT (Deprecated)
  + LLJIT (Based on ORCv2)
  + LazyLLJIT (Based on LLJIT)
- Use LLVM's ORCv2 directly to create an engine
* DONE Episode 15 - LLVM ORC JIT
CLOSED: [2022-01-28 Fri 12:15]
** Uptades:
- Created a bare min JIT that:
  - Eagrly compiles namespaces
  - Reload namespacs
- I guess this the time to start the Serene's Spec

** What is ORCv2?
- On request compiler
- Replaces MCJIT
- ORCv2 docs and examples
- Kaleidoscope tutorial (not complete)

Before We can move to Serene's code we need to understand ORC first

** Terminology
*** Execution Session
A running JIT program. It contains the JITDylibs, error reporting mechanisms, and dispatches
the materializers.

*** JITAddress
It's just an address of a JITed code

*** JITDylib
Represents a JIT'd dynamic library.

This class aims to mimic the behavior of a shared object, but without requiring
the contained program representations to be compiled up-front. The JITDylib's
content is defined by adding MaterializationUnits, and contained MaterializationUnits
will typically rely on the JITDylib's links-against order to resolve external references.

JITDylibs cannot be moved or copied. Their address is stable, and useful as
a key in some JIT data structures.

*** MaterializationUnit
  A =MaterializationUnit= represents a set of symbol definitions that can
  be materialized as a group, or individually discarded (when
  overriding definitions are encountered).

  =MaterializationUnits= are used when providing lazy definitions of symbols to
  JITDylibs. The JITDylib will call materialize when the address of a symbol
  is requested via the lookup method. The =JITDylib= will call discard if a
  stronger definition is added or already present.

  MaterializationUnit stores in JITDylibs.

*** MaterializationResponsibility
  Represents and tracks responsibility for materialization and mediates interactions between
  =MaterializationUnits= and =JITDylibs=. It provides a way for Dylib to find out about the outcome
  of the materialization.

*** Memory Manager
A class that manages how JIT engine should use memory, like allocations and deallocations.
=SectionMemoryManager= is a simple memory manager that is provided by ORC.

*** Layers
ORC based JIT engines are constructed from several layers. Each layer has a specific responsiblity
and passes the result of its operation to the next layer. E.g Compile Layer, Link layer and ....

*** Resource Tracker
The API to remove or transfer the ownership of JIT resources. Usually, a resource is a module.

*** ThreadSafeModule
A thread safe container for the LLVM module.

** ORC highlevel API
- ORC provides a Layer based design to that let us create our own JIT engine.
- It comes with two ready to use engines:
  We will look at their implementaion later
  + LLJIT
  + LLLazyJIT

** Two major solutions to build a JIT
- Wrap LLJIT or LLLazyJIT
- Create your own JIT engine and the wrapper

* DONE Eposide 16 - ORC Layers
CLOSED: [2022-02-26 Sat 12:50]
** Updates:
*** Support for adding AST directly to the JIT
*** Minor change to SLIR (big changes are coming)
*** Started to unify the llvm::Errors with Serene errors
*** Tablegen backend for error classes
** The plan for today
- We had a brief look at LLJIT/LLLazyJIT
- Better understanding
  To understand them better we need to understand other components first. Starting from *layers*.
- We'll have a look at how to define our own layers in the future episodes.

** What are Layers?
- Layers are the basic blocks of an engine
- They are composable (kinda)
- Each layer has it's own requirements and details
- Each layer holds a reference to it's downstream layer

* DONE Episode 17 - Custom ORC Layers
CLOSED: [2022-03-28 Mon 14:00]
** Updates:
- Finished the basic compiler wiring
- Restructured the source tree
- Tweaked the build system mostly for install targets
- Refactoring, cleaning up the code and writing tests
** Quick overview an ORC based JIT engine
- JIT engines are made out of layers
- Engines have a hierarchy of layers
- Layers don't know about each other
- Layers wrap the program representation in a =MaterializationUnit=, which is
  then stored in the =JITDylib=.
- =MaterializationUnits= are responsible for describing the definitions they provide,
  and for unwrapping the program representation and passing it back to the layer when
  compilation is required.
- When a =MaterializationUnit= hands a program representation back to the layer it comes
  with an associated =MaterializationResponsibility= object. This object tracks the
  definitions that must be materialized and provides a way to notify the =JITDylib= once
  they are either successfully materialized or a failure occurs.

** In order to build a custom layer we need:
*** A custom materialization unit
Let's have a look at the =MaterializationUnit= class.

*** And the layer class itself
The layer classes are not special but conventionally the come with few functions
like: =add=, =emit= and =getInterface=.

* DONE Episode 18 - JIT Engine Part 1
CLOSED: [2022-03-29 Tue 19:56]
** =Halley= JIT Engine
- It's not the final implementation
- Wraps LLJIT and LLLazyJIT
- Uses object cache layer
- Supports ASTs and Namespaces

* DONE Episode 19 - JIT Engine Part 2
CLOSED: [2022-05-04 Wed 21:30]
** How Serene is different from other programming langs?
- Serene is just a JIT engine
- Compiletime vs Runtime
  + The borderline is not clear in case of Serene
